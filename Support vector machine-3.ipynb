    "In a scenraio with a signficant number of outliers the most appropriate regression matrix to use with your FBM model would be a robust regression matrix robust regression techniques such as huber or turkey bisquare are designed to be less senstive to outliers compared to tradtional ordinary least square regression .These techniques downeight the influence of outliers therby providing more robustt paramter estimate and improving the overall performance of the model in the prsence of outliers."
